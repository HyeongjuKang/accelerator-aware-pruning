### Introduction

Accelerator-aware pruning(AAP) is a pruning scheme that considers an acceleartor
	structure.
With accelerator-aware pruning, you can imporove the operator utilization
	of the sparse NN accelerators like Cambricon-X and EIE,
	and can design a sparse NN accelerator with much lower complexity.
For more details, please refer to my [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09862).
The paper is under review for IEEE Transactions on
	Circuits and Systems for Video Technology.
